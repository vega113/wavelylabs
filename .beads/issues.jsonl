The changes are well-scoped and the test updates match the HTML changes.\n\n### Verdict: **Approve** (with minor observations)\n\n---\n\n### What's good\n\n1. **Placeholder removal is complete** — both product cards now use real `.webp` screenshots instead of text-only figcaptions. This directly addresses the trust/UX goal.\n\n2. **Performance attributes are thorough** — every `\u003cimg\u003e` now has `loading=\"lazy\"`, `decoding=\"async\"`, and explicit `width`/`height`. This prevents layout shift (CLS) and is the right approach for a static site.\n\n3. **Test coverage follows the changes** — the required-text list was updated, and a new forbidden-text block ensures placeholders can't silently return. Good defensive testing.\n\n4. **WebP-only image delivery** — `.gitignore` adding `/.images/` suggests source/intermediate images are kept out of the repo while only optimized WebP assets ship. Correct pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Minor observations (non-blocking)\n\n**1. Duplicate image in product card + proof section**\n\nBoth the SlidesLab product card and the \"Generation Status (variants view)\" proof card use `slideslab-generation-status.webp`. Same for Tube2Web's `tube2web-creator-dashboard-grid.webp`. This is intentional (card hero + detail section), but worth confirming the visual intent — users will see the same image twice on scroll.\n\n**2. Tall image aspect ratio**\n\n`slideslab-recent-generations-dashboard.webp` is declared as `900×2592` — nearly 3:1 portrait. On desktop this will render very tall inside `.proof-card`. Verify that `max-height` or `object-fit` in CSS constrains this reasonably, especially on wide viewports.\n\n**3. Test assertion specificity**\n\nThe test checks for `width=\"1600\"` and `height=\"921\"` as raw strings, which will match any image with those dimensions (not specifically the product card images). If a future image happens to share those dimensions, the test won't catch a missing product screenshot. Low risk for a small page, but worth noting.\n\n**4. No `fetchpriority` on above-the-fold content**\n\nIf either product card is visible on initial load (before scroll), `loading=\"lazy\"` may actually delay the hero screenshot. Consider `fetchpriority=\"high\"` and removing `loading=\"lazy\"` for the first visible image. This is a refinement, not a regression.\n\n---\n\n### Checklist against acceptance criteria\n\n| Criteria | Status |\n|---|---|\n| Product cards use real screenshots | Pass — both cards have `.webp` images with descriptive alt text |\n| Image delivery is performance-oriented | Pass — `lazy`, `decoding=async`, explicit dimensions on all images |\n| No regression in legal/compliance content | Pass — privacy/terms checks unchanged in test suite |\n| Readable on mobile and desktop | No CSS changes in diff — existing responsive styles apply. Verify the 900×2592 image manually on mobile |\n","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:19:56Z"},{"id":4,"issue_id":"wavelylabs-d3d","author":"Yuri Z.","text":"Round 2 Claude review: prior observations addressed; remaining notes were low-severity polish.","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:23:28Z"},{"id":5,"issue_id":"wavelylabs-d3d","author":"Yuri Z.","text":"\n\n## Review: wavelylabs-d3d Round 2\n\n### Observation checklist\n\n| Prior observation | Addressed? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Avoid duplicate visuals between product cards and proof section | **Yes** | Product cards now use distinct screenshots (`slideslab-pricing-page.webp`, `tube2web-public-generated-site.webp`) while proof section uses different shots (generation status, dashboard, import modal, etc.). The pricing-page image *does* appear in both the SlidesLab card and the proof \"Pricing Page\" card — but that's a minor overlap, not the original problem of placeholder-vs-real duplication. |\n| Handle tall portrait screenshot rendering | **Yes** | `.portrait-fit` class added with `object-fit: contain; object-position: top center; background: #0d1c29` and applied to the tall dashboard image (900×2592). |\n| Improve test specificity for product image slots | **Yes** | Tests now assert full `\u003cimg\u003e` attribute strings for both product cards, check for the `portrait-fit` class, and include a forbidden-text block rejecting old placeholder strings. |\n| Add above-the-fold fetch priority | **Yes** | First product image has `loading=\"eager\" fetchpriority=\"high\"`, second card correctly stays `loading=\"lazy\"`. Tests verify these attributes. |\n\n### New observations\n\n1. **`.product-shot img` uses a bare `height: 250px` without `object-fit`** — The rule at `styles.css` sets a fixed height but doesn't specify `object-fit`, so landscape and portrait product screenshots will stretch or compress depending on their aspect ratio. The `.portrait-fit` utility solves this for the proof section, but the product cards don't use it. Consider adding `object-fit: cover` (or `contain`) to `.product-shot img` to prevent distortion as product images are swapped in the future.\n\n2. **Duplicate image: `slideslab-pricing-page.webp` appears in both the product card and the proof section** — This is the exact class of issue observation #1 targeted. The SlidesLab product card and the \"Pricing Page\" proof card both render the same file. If this is intentional (proof section validates the card screenshot), it's acceptable but worth a comment or conscious decision. If not, one should be swapped to a different screenshot.\n\n3. **Explicit `width`/`height` on all images is good, but `decoding=\"async\"` test is non-specific** — The test line `\"decoding=\\\"async\\\"\"` will match any image in the file, not specifically a product card. It doesn't break anything but doesn't add signal beyond the two full-attribute-string checks that follow it. Same applies to `\"fetchpriority=\\\"high\\\"\"` and `\"loading=\\\"eager\\\"\"`. These three lines are redundant given the specific assertions below them.\n\n### Severity\n\nAll three observations are **low severity** — no functional bugs, no accessibility regressions, no performance issues. The changes correctly address the four prior observations. Ship-ready as-is; the above are polish items for a future pass.\n","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:23:28Z"},{"id":6,"issue_id":"wavelylabs-d3d","author":"Yuri Z.","text":"Round 3 Claude review: PASS, ship-ready, no blockers.","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:23:28Z"},{"id":7,"issue_id":"wavelylabs-d3d","author":"Yuri Z.","text":"## Code Review: wavelylabs-d3d Round 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis round replaces placeholder text with real product screenshots, adds image performance attributes, and updates tests to enforce the new state. Clean, focused changes.\n\n### Verdict: **Pass** — ship it.\n\n---\n\n### Observations\n\n**Positive**\n\n1. **Placeholder removal is complete and enforced.** Both `mockshot` placeholders replaced with real `\u003cimg\u003e` tags, and the test now has a forbidden-text check preventing regression. Good defensive testing.\n\n2. **Image performance attributes are thorough.** All images now carry `decoding=\"async\"`, explicit `width`/`height` (CLS prevention), and the hero image correctly uses `loading=\"eager\"` + `fetchpriority=\"high\"` while gallery images use `loading=\"lazy\"`.\n\n3. **Portrait image handled well.** The `portrait-fit` class with `object-fit: contain` and `object-position: top center` is a clean solution for the tall dashboard screenshot. The dark background (`#0d1c29`) avoids letterbox flash.\n\n4. **Responsive breakpoint covered.** The `@media` rule drops `.product-shot img` height from 250px to 210px, keeping cards proportionate on smaller screens.\n\n**Minor nits** (non-blocking)\n\n1. **Duplicate image source, different context.** `tube2web-public-generated-site.webp` is used both as the product hero card image and again in the \"Product Examples\" gallery below. Not a bug — intentional reuse — but if a distinct hero crop ever becomes available, this is the spot to swap it.\n\n2. **`.portrait-fit` is applied directly to `\u003cimg\u003e` but targets different specificity than `.product-shot img`.** Currently fine since the portrait image isn't inside `.product-shot`, but worth noting if the class is reused elsewhere in the future.\n\n3. **Test string assertions are brittle by design** (checking raw HTML attribute strings like `width=\\\"1440\\\" height=\\\"810\\\"`). Acceptable for a small static site, but would become a maintenance burden at scale. Fine for now.\n\nNo functional issues, no accessibility regressions, no security concerns. Tests pass. Ready to close and push.\n","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:23:28Z"}]}
