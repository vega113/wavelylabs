A developer would have to infer card anatomy, modal behavior, etc. |\n| 5 | Plan defines typography decisions | **Partially met** | Font families chosen (`Sora`/`Outfit`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`) and token names listed, but **no actual values** for `--fs-hero`, `--fs-h1`, etc. No line-height or weight spec. |\n| 6 | Plan defines color decisions | **Partially met** | One hex value given (`#e9eff3`). Deep navy ink, cyan/teal accent, muted green/blue chips are described but not specified. A designer or developer cannot implement from prose alone. |\n| 7 | Plan defines responsive decisions | **Met** | Breakpoints defined, touch target minimums stated, grid approach outlined. |\n| 8 | Plan defines performance decisions | **Met** | Section 9 is concrete and appropriate for the stack. |\n| 9 | Plan includes phased execution | **Partially met** | Four phases listed with scope descriptions, but no per-phase acceptance criteria, no ordering dependencies between phases, and no indication of what can be parallelized. |\n| 10 | Plan includes measurable acceptance criteria | **Partially met** | Section 11 has 5 criteria but they are qualitative (\"looks clearly premium,\" \"comfortable\"). Only one is measurable (Lighthouse). Need specific thresholds (e.g., LCP \u003c 1.5s, contrast ratios, touch target px minimums per WCAG). |\n| 11 | Plan remains realistic for static-site stack | **Met** | Explicitly scoped to HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no frameworks, no CMS. Section 12 out-of-scope is well-defined. |\n\n---\n\n## 1) Blockers (must-fix)\n\n**None** — this is a planning artifact, not code. No runtime risk. However, the following would block a clean handoff to implementation:\n\n- **B1: Color system is not implementable as written.** Only one hex provided. Add a full token table: background, surface, ink, accent-primary, accent-secondary, success, error, border, with hex values and WCAG AA contrast verification against their expected text pairings. Without this, Phase 1 cannot begin without design interpretation.\n\n- **B2: Type scale has no values.** Token names (`--fs-hero` etc.) are listed but never defined. Add the actual `rem`/`px` values, line-heights, and font-weights. This is the single most impactful visual system decision and it's currently a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Important Concerns\n\n- **I1: No compliance content regression safeguard.** The plan says \"preserve\" multiple times but doesn't define how. Add a concrete step: snapshot all compliance-sensitive text (operator identity, jurisdiction, beta billing copy, support channels) before Phase 1 and diff-check after each phase. This is the highest-risk non-visual concern given the task context.\n\n- **I2: Phase acceptance criteria are missing.** Section 11 only covers the final state. Each phase (especially Phase 1 and Phase 4) needs its own \"definition of done.\" Without this, there's no way to gate progression or catch regressions mid-implementation.\n\n- **I3: Font loading strategy is unspecified.** Two new Google Fonts families (`Sora`/`Plus Jakarta Sans`) will add load time. The performance section (9) doesn't address font loading — needs `font-display: swap`, subsetting strategy, or self-hosting decision. This directly contradicts the \"keep it fast\" constraint if not handled.\n\n- **I4: Hero \"split composition\" lacks mobile-first detail.** The plan says \"stacked on mobile\" but the current hero is already stacked. What specifically changes on mobile? The gap analysis calls out \"cramped nav/chips\" but the hero redesign doesn't address how the \"trust chips + primary CTA row\" behaves at 320-480px widths.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Minor Nits\n\n- **N1:** Section 5 heading structure is inconsistent — `## Home`, `## About`, `## Legal` are at the same level as `## 5. Proposed Information Architecture`, making them look like top-level sections in the TOC. Nest them as `###`.\n\n- **N2:** Option A description says \"cyan/teal accent lighting\" and later the color system says \"cyan/teal gradient for AI cues\" — clarify whether this is a flat accent color, a gradient, or both. Precision here prevents Phase 1 interpretation drift.\n\n- **N3:** \"Accent italic line only where needed (keep current serif usage minimal)\" — unclear what \"accent italic line\" refers to. If this is an existing site element, name it. If it's a new element, describe it.\n\n- **N4:** The `Sora` vs `Outfit` choice is presented as either/or with no decision criteria. Pick one or state the decision trigger (\"test both at heading sizes and choose based on X\").\n\n---\n\n## 4) Missing Tests / Coverage Gaps\n\nSince this is a planning document, \"tests\" translate to verification criteria:\n\n- **T1: No visual regression baseline defined.** Before any implementation, capture current-state screenshots at all breakpoints for all pages. The plan mentions `.review/` screenshots exist — formalize these as the regression baseline.\n\n- **T2: No Lighthouse budget stated.** Section 11 says \"Lighthouse-level performance remains strong\" but doesn't define thresholds. Add: LCP \u003c 1.5s, CLS \u003c 0.1, TBT \u003c 200ms (reasonable for a static site). These become automated gates in Phase 4.\n\n- **T3: No content diff check in Phase 4.** Add an explicit step: diff all `\u003cmain\u003e` text content between v1 and v2 to catch accidental copy deletions, especially in legal pages.\n\n---\n\n## 5) UX / A11y Concerns\n\n- **A1: Touch target spec is incomplete.** Plan says \"40-44px\" for nav chips. WCAG 2.2 AAA requires 44x44px minimum; AA requires 24x24px. Clarify which level you're targeting and apply it consistently to all interactive elements (CTAs, example card links, footer links), not just nav chips.\n\n- **A2: Modal interaction spec is vague.** \"Ensure all image modal interactions are keyboard and screen-reader friendly\" — this needs specifics: focus trap, Escape to close, `role=\"dialog\"`, `aria-modal=\"true\"`, return focus to trigger on close. Without these, the implementation will likely miss at least one.\n\n- **A3: No skip-link or landmark plan.** The IA restructuring is a good opportunity to ensure proper `\u003cmain\u003e`, `\u003cnav\u003e`, `\u003caside\u003e`, and skip-to-content links. Not mentioned.\n\n- **A4: Color contrast for the proposed palette is unverified.** Cool mist background (`#e9eff3`) with \"muted green/blue indicators\" risks failing AA contrast. The plan should include contrast ratio checks for all text-on-background combinations before committing to the palette.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Performance Pitfalls\n\n- **P1: Two new web fonts without loading strategy** (see I3 above). Each font family adds ~20-80KB depending on weights/subsets. Current site may use system fonts or a single family — adding two is a measurable regression if not managed.\n\n- **P2: \"Staggered fade-up on section entrance\" implies an Intersection Observer implementation.** This is fine for vanilla JS but needs to be budgeted. Ensure the animation JS is \u003c2KB and doesn't block rendering. Consider CSS-only `@starting-style` or `animation-timeline: view()` for zero-JS fallback where browser support allows.\n\n- **P3: \"Subtle gradient dividers\" and \"elevation\" tokens may tempt `box-shadow` or `backdrop-filter` usage.** These are GPU-composited and fine in moderation, but the plan should note to avoid stacking multiple blur/shadow layers that cause paint storms on mobile.\n\n---\n\n## Verdict\n\n**Approve with revisions.** The plan demonstrates genuine UX thinking and appropriate constraint awareness. The gaps are specificity gaps, not direction gaps. Address B1, B2, I1, and I2 before moving to implementation — everything else can be refined as Phase 1 begins.\n","created_at":"2026-02-12T15:26:26Z"},{"id":11,"issue_id":"wavelylabs-484","author":"Yuri Z.","text":"Round 2 Claude review: no blockers.

This is acceptable for a plan artifact if Phase 4 DoD enforces verification, which it does.\n- **Overall verdict**: Plan is **approval-ready** with one minor clarification needed (see item below).\n\n---\n\n## 0. Goal Completeness\n\n| Criterion | Status | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Prior blockers on token specificity resolved | **Met** | Section 6 provides concrete CSS custom property values with exact units (clamp, rem, px, hex). No ambiguous tokens remain. |\n| Phase-level DoD is explicit | **Met** | Section 13 defines DoD per phase with dependency chains. |\n| Compliance safeguards are explicit | **Met** | Section 12 defines pre-implementation snapshot + per-phase diff + test script extension protocol. |\n| Plan remains realistic for static stack | **Met** | No build tools, frameworks, or runtime dependencies introduced. Font fallback to self-hosted WOFF2 is specified. JS budget enforced. |\n| Implementation-ready for task decomposition | **Met** | Phases are sequentially dependent with clear scope boundaries. Component specs (Section 7) are detailed enough for individual task cards. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Blockers (must-fix)\n\n**None.** The plan is a design/planning artifact, not executable code. No runtime bugs or data-loss vectors exist at this stage.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Important Concerns\n\n**2a. `./tests/site-content.sh` existence and scope** — Section 12 says \"Re-run `./tests/site-content.sh` and extend checks for any new compliance-critical strings.\" If this script doesn't exist yet, the plan should call out \"create\" rather than \"extend.\" If it does exist, it should be referenced in Phase 1's DoD as a prerequisite step (snapshot creation). This is the only gap that could cause compliance safeguards to be skipped during execution.\n\n**Recommendation**: Add to Phase 1 DoD: \"Compliance baseline snapshot captured and `./tests/site-content.sh` confirmed or created.\"\n\n**2b. Font weight mismatch** — Section 6.1 defines `--fw-body: 500` but Section 11 loads Plus Jakarta Sans at weights `500, 600, 700`. Sora is loaded at `600, 700` but `--fw-display` and `--fw-heading` are both `700`. The weight `600` for Sora would only be used by `--fw-meta` if meta text uses the display font — but the plan doesn't specify which font meta text uses. This ambiguity could lead to loading an unused weight.\n\n**Recommendation**: Either specify font-family assignment per token role (display, heading, body, meta) or trim unused weights from the load list.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Minor Nits\n\n**3a. `--lh-tight: 1.08`** — This is unusually tight and may cause descender clipping on hero text at large sizes, especially with Sora's geometry. Consider `1.1` as a safer floor, or note this needs visual QA in Phase 1.\n\n**3b. Section numbering formatting** — Sections 6.1–6.3 use `##` (h2) instead of `###` (h3), breaking the heading hierarchy under `## 6. Design System`. This is cosmetic but will matter if the plan is rendered as navigable documentation.\n\n**3c. Breakpoint gap** — The breakpoints list `\u003c= 480px`, `481-820px`, `\u003e 820px` but the hero spec uses `\u003e 820px` / `\u003c= 820px` as a two-way split. The three-tier breakpoint system is only exercised in the grid behavior rules. Clarifying whether the hero has a tablet-specific layout (481–820) or collapses to mobile at that range would prevent ambiguity during implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Missing Tests / Coverage Gaps\n\nThis is a planning artifact, so \"tests\" here means verification mechanisms:\n\n- **Compliance snapshot tooling**: As noted in 2a, the test script's existence/creation must be a gated deliverable, not an assumption.\n- **Contrast verification**: Phase 4 DoD should explicitly require running a contrast checker tool (e.g., manual check or automated via a script) against the final token pairs, not just visual inspection.\n- **Performance gate enforcement**: Phase 4 lists LCP/CLS/TBT targets. The plan should specify the measurement tool (Lighthouse, WebPageTest, etc.) and conditions (throttled 4G, specific device profile) to prevent ambiguous pass/fail.\n\n---\n\n## 5. UX / A11y Concerns\n\n**Strengths**: The plan is notably thorough here — lightbox accessibility spec (7.6), skip links, focus rings, `prefers-reduced-motion`, touch target minimums, and semantic landmarks are all explicitly called out.\n\n**5a. Touch target discrepancy** — Section 10 states minimum `24x24px` functional target but preferred `44x44px` for primary nav/CTAs. The header spec (7.1) mandates `44px` min-height for nav chips. Ensure the `24px` minimum isn't applied to nav elements during implementation — the plan should clarify that `24px` applies only to secondary/tertiary interactive elements (e.g., footer links, TOC anchors).\n\n**5b. Lightbox focus trap scope** — Section 7.6 specifies focus trap but doesn't mention `inert` on background content. For a vanilla JS implementation, `inert` attribute on siblings is the simplest correct approach. Worth noting in the spec to prevent implementers from building a custom focus-trap loop.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Performance Pitfalls\n\n**6a. Three Google Fonts families** — Loading Sora + Plus Jakarta Sans + Instrument Serif is three separate font families. Even with subsetting, this risks LCP regression on slow connections. The fallback plan (self-host WOFF2) is good but should be the **default** strategy for a static site on Cloudflare Pages, not a fallback. Cloudflare Pages can serve WOFF2 from the same edge, eliminating the font-host round trip entirely.\n\n**Recommendation**: Default to self-hosted subsetted WOFF2; use Google Fonts only during development for convenience.\n\n**6b. JS budget is reasonable** — 8KB gzipped for fade-in animations + lightbox + TOC behavior is achievable. No concern here.\n\n---\n\n## Verdict\n\n**Approve with one recommended addition**: Add compliance snapshot creation as an explicit Phase 1 deliverable (concern 2a). All other items are advisory improvements that can be addressed during task decomposition or implementation. The plan is ready for breakdown into beads tasks.\n","created_at":"2026-02-12T15:29:19Z"},{"id":13,"issue_id":"wavelylabs-484","author":"Yuri Z.","text":"Task decomposition created: wavelylabs-484.1 (tokens/layout), wavelylabs-484.2 (header/hero), wavelylabs-484.3 (products+narrative+examples), wavelylabs-484.4 (about/privacy/terms polish), wavelylabs-484.5 (a11y/modal hardening), wavelylabs-484.6 (final perf+compliance gate).

The changes are well-scoped and the test updates match the HTML changes.\n\n### Verdict: **Approve** (with minor observations)\n\n---\n\n### What's good\n\n1. **Placeholder removal is complete** — both product cards now use real `.webp` screenshots instead of text-only figcaptions. This directly addresses the trust/UX goal.\n\n2. **Performance attributes are thorough** — every `\u003cimg\u003e` now has `loading=\"lazy\"`, `decoding=\"async\"`, and explicit `width`/`height`. This prevents layout shift (CLS) and is the right approach for a static site.\n\n3. **Test coverage follows the changes** — the required-text list was updated, and a new forbidden-text block ensures placeholders can't silently return. Good defensive testing.\n\n4. **WebP-only image delivery** — `.gitignore` adding `/.images/` suggests source/intermediate images are kept out of the repo while only optimized WebP assets ship. Correct pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Minor observations (non-blocking)\n\n**1. Duplicate image in product card + proof section**\n\nBoth the SlidesLab product card and the \"Generation Status (variants view)\" proof card use `slideslab-generation-status.webp`. Same for Tube2Web's `tube2web-creator-dashboard-grid.webp`. This is intentional (card hero + detail section), but worth confirming the visual intent — users will see the same image twice on scroll.\n\n**2. Tall image aspect ratio**\n\n`slideslab-recent-generations-dashboard.webp` is declared as `900×2592` — nearly 3:1 portrait. On desktop this will render very tall inside `.proof-card`. Verify that `max-height` or `object-fit` in CSS constrains this reasonably, especially on wide viewports.\n\n**3. Test assertion specificity**\n\nThe test checks for `width=\"1600\"` and `height=\"921\"` as raw strings, which will match any image with those dimensions (not specifically the product card images). If a future image happens to share those dimensions, the test won't catch a missing product screenshot. Low risk for a small page, but worth noting.\n\n**4. No `fetchpriority` on above-the-fold content**\n\nIf either product card is visible on initial load (before scroll), `loading=\"lazy\"` may actually delay the hero screenshot. Consider `fetchpriority=\"high\"` and removing `loading=\"lazy\"` for the first visible image. This is a refinement, not a regression.\n\n---\n\n### Checklist against acceptance criteria\n\n| Criteria | Status |\n|---|---|\n| Product cards use real screenshots | Pass — both cards have `.webp` images with descriptive alt text |\n| Image delivery is performance-oriented | Pass — `lazy`, `decoding=async`, explicit dimensions on all images |\n| No regression in legal/compliance content | Pass — privacy/terms checks unchanged in test suite |\n| Readable on mobile and desktop | No CSS changes in diff — existing responsive styles apply.

The pricing-page image *does* appear in both the SlidesLab card and the proof \"Pricing Page\" card — but that's a minor overlap, not the original problem of placeholder-vs-real duplication. |\n| Handle tall portrait screenshot rendering | **Yes** | `.portrait-fit` class added with `object-fit: contain; object-position: top center; background: #0d1c29` and applied to the tall dashboard image (900×2592). |\n| Improve test specificity for product image slots | **Yes** | Tests now assert full `\u003cimg\u003e` attribute strings for both product cards, check for the `portrait-fit` class, and include a forbidden-text block rejecting old placeholder strings. |\n| Add above-the-fold fetch priority | **Yes** | First product image has `loading=\"eager\" fetchpriority=\"high\"`, second card correctly stays `loading=\"lazy\"`. Tests verify these attributes. |\n\n### New observations\n\n1. **`.product-shot img` uses a bare `height: 250px` without `object-fit`** — The rule at `styles.css` sets a fixed height but doesn't specify `object-fit`, so landscape and portrait product screenshots will stretch or compress depending on their aspect ratio. The `.portrait-fit` utility solves this for the proof section, but the product cards don't use it. Consider adding `object-fit: cover` (or `contain`) to `.product-shot img` to prevent distortion as product images are swapped in the future.\n\n2. **Duplicate image: `slideslab-pricing-page.webp` appears in both the product card and the proof section** — This is the exact class of issue observation #1 targeted. The SlidesLab product card and the \"Pricing Page\" proof card both render the same file. If this is intentional (proof section validates the card screenshot), it's acceptable but worth a comment or conscious decision. If not, one should be swapped to a different screenshot.\n\n3. **Explicit `width`/`height` on all images is good, but `decoding=\"async\"` test is non-specific** — The test line `\"decoding=\\\"async\\\"\"` will match any image in the file, not specifically a product card. It doesn't break anything but doesn't add signal beyond the two full-attribute-string checks that follow it. Same applies to `\"fetchpriority=\\\"high\\\"\"` and `\"loading=\\\"eager\\\"\"`. These three lines are redundant given the specific assertions below them.\n\n### Severity\n\nAll three observations are **low severity** — no functional bugs, no accessibility regressions, no performance issues. The changes correctly address the four prior observations.

Good defensive testing.\n\n2. **Image performance attributes are thorough.** All images now carry `decoding=\"async\"`, explicit `width`/`height` (CLS prevention), and the hero image correctly uses `loading=\"eager\"` + `fetchpriority=\"high\"` while gallery images use `loading=\"lazy\"`.\n\n3. **Portrait image handled well.** The `portrait-fit` class with `object-fit: contain` and `object-position: top center` is a clean solution for the tall dashboard screenshot. The dark background (`#0d1c29`) avoids letterbox flash.\n\n4. **Responsive breakpoint covered.** The `@media` rule drops `.product-shot img` height from 250px to 210px, keeping cards proportionate on smaller screens.\n\n**Minor nits** (non-blocking)\n\n1. **Duplicate image source, different context.** `tube2web-public-generated-site.webp` is used both as the product hero card image and again in the \"Product Examples\" gallery below. Not a bug — intentional reuse — but if a distinct hero crop ever becomes available, this is the spot to swap it.\n\n2. **`.portrait-fit` is applied directly to `\u003cimg\u003e` but targets different specificity than `.product-shot img`.** Currently fine since the portrait image isn't inside `.product-shot`, but worth noting if the class is reused elsewhere in the future.\n\n3. **Test string assertions are brittle by design** (checking raw HTML attribute strings like `width=\\\"1440\\\" height=\\\"810\\\"`). Acceptable for a small static site, but would become a maintenance burden at scale. Fine for now.\n\nNo functional issues, no accessibility regressions, no security concerns. Tests pass.
