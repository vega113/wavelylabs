      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

      <h2>Operator</h2>
      <p>WavelyLabs is operated by Yuri Zelikov (sole proprietor), based in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>These Terms govern your use of <strong>wavelylabs.com</strong> and WavelyLabs-operated services. Product-specific usage terms may apply on product domains (including SlidesLab and Tube2Web) and control where they differ.</p>

      <h2>Public Beta Status</h2>
      <p>WavelyLabs products are currently in public beta. Features, limits, and pricing presentation may change before general availability.</p>

      <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You must use the services lawfully and must not abuse, disrupt, reverse engineer, infringe third-party rights, or attempt unauthorized access to systems or data.</p>

      <h2>User Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of your own content. WavelyLabs retains rights in its software, infrastructure, and branding. You grant WavelyLabs the limited rights required to host, process, and deliver your content as part of the service.</p>

      <h2>AI Output Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>AI-generated outputs may contain inaccuracies. You are responsible for reviewing outputs before publishing, sharing, or relying on them.</p>

      <h2>Pricing, Billing, and Merchant of Record</h2>
      <p>Pricing is publicly visible during beta. Checkout and billing activation may remain disabled until launch. Once billing is enabled, purchases are processed by the configured Merchant of Record provider (Lemon Squeezy or Polar), which handles payment processing, taxes/VAT, invoicing, refunds, and chargeback workflows according to its policies.</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms, abuse, security risk, or legal requirements.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, WavelyLabs is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to the amount paid by you to WavelyLabs in the 12 months before the claim, or USD $100 if no amount was paid.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Israel. Disputes are subject to the competent courts in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes are reflected by the "Last updated" date on this page.</p>
